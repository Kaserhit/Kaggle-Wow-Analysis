According to the creator, Myles O'Neill, this sample includes information about characters that players had on servers in the year 2008. Specifically, it focuses on a sample from the \"Horde\" faction server population. The dataset allows for analysis of player preferences, such as popular zones with high player traffic, preferred races, and favored classes that players enjoyed playing.","metadata":{"id":"UbcuJhLsqj0s"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Development of Point 2**\nUse Pandas to load the downloaded CSV

This is because, in the context of the game, there is a limitation where not all races can be all classes, or some races have greater benefits for the class they play.\n\n- Another association could exist between the Zone and the player's level. This is because, in the game, for a player to progress or be limited in their development, they must start in low-level zones and progress to more advanced zones. It could also be due to zones with higher social interaction (Capitals) or zones that are less friendly to the player because they are controlled by the enemy.\n\n- Finally, another relationship could reside between the Zone and the Guild variable.

However, what will help answer the question is the repetition of patterns that predominantly occur at the maximum level.
